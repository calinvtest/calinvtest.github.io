# Clean Architecture Notes
Design and architecture are the same thing, in spite having the missconceptions that the architecture is concerned with the high level structure of the system and the design with the low level details. They are the same because the high level decisions must be based on the low level details like a house architecture is done.

The goal of the software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build the required system.

The quality of a design is measured by how much effort is needed to build the system. If the effort is low then we have a quality design.

Anyone can write code that just work, but it's difficult to write code that is right which doesn't take a lot of effort to modify.
